# DicePoker

## Author: Dave Christopher Lake

Dice poker is a game written in the Java Programming language which allows for the computer to roll a predetermined number of standard six-sided dice while the user/player bets on the outcome for a predetermined number of rounds and then updates the player’s bank balance based of the results of the dice roll:
•	Sequential numbers earn double the bet amount.
•	Identical numbers earn triple the bet amount
•	Any other outcome causes the player to lose their bet.

The game utilizes a graphical user interface (JOptionPane) which allows the player to first input their name, as well as their desired bet within a range. Once the game has finished (all bets have been placed or you ran out of money) the computer collates and display the results in a single message box, comprised by:
- One row per bet, displaying the bet amount, the numbers rolled, the amount of money earned or lost for that bet.
- One row at the end, displaying the amount of money that remaining in the bank at the end of the game.
- A high score table which shows which players finish with the most money in the bank at the end of the game.
